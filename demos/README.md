```python
# In creative_collaboration_demo.py
class CustomCreativeAgent(CreativeAgent):
    def __init__(self, specialization):
        super().__init__("CUSTOM", specialization)
        
    def generate_contribution(self, context, iteration):
        # Your custom contribution logic
        pass
```

### Modifying Visualization Styles
```html
<!-- In interactive_visualizer.py HTML templates -->
<style>
    /* Customize colors, layouts, animations */
    .your-custom-styles {
        /* Your styling */
    }
</style>
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Mock vs Live LLM
```python
# Use mock responses for demo purposes
demo = ComprehensiveDemo()
